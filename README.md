## Overview

Copilot Insights gives you a fast, local view of the quota and entitlement data already associated with your GitHub Copilot account.

It focuses on operational visibility, not team analytics. The extension helps answer practical questions such as:

- How much premium quota do I have left?
- When does it reset?
- Am I burning through quota faster than expected?
- Do I have overage enabled?
- Which organizations are providing my Copilot access?

## Highlights

- Sidebar view with plan details, quota cards, pacing guidance, overage messaging, and organization access.
- Premium usage trend tracking using locally stored snapshots.
- Weighted prediction and burn-rate analysis for premium interactions.
- Status bar indicator with configurable placement, style, and content.
- One-click export to clipboard as Markdown or raw JSON.
- Auto-refresh when the Insights view becomes visible, plus manual refresh and settings actions.
- Fractional precision for premium usage values and percentages so displayed numbers better match Copilot reporting.

## What You Get

### Sidebar view

The Copilot Insights activity bar view shows:

- Plan summary, chat availability, and organization count.
- Quotas for Copilot features, including correct handling for unlimited quotas.
- Remaining, used, total, and percentage information for limited quotas.
- Health badges or mood indicators based on remaining premium quota.
- Reset timing and pacing guidance to help spread usage across the billing window.
- Overage state, over-quota summary, and estimated overage cost when applicable.
- Local snapshot history with trend chart and delta comparisons.
- Weighted prediction and burn-rate analysis for premium interactions.
- Troubleshooting context when the endpoint fails or returns stale data.

### Status bar

The status bar provides a compact premium quota summary that can be shown on the left, right, or both sides.

Available styles:

- detailed-original
- progress-capsule
- circular-ring
- solid-bar
- shaded-bar
- minimalist
- adaptive-emoji

You can independently control whether the label, numeric quota, and visual indicator are shown.

### Clipboard export

From the webview you can copy:

- A Markdown summary for sharing in docs, issues, or chat.
- The raw Copilot payload as formatted JSON.

## Installation

Install from the Visual Studio Marketplace:

- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emanuelebartolesi.vscode-copilot-insights

You can also package and install locally from a VSIX during development.

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension.
2. Open the Copilot Insights icon in the VS Code activity bar.
3. Sign in with GitHub if VS Code prompts for authentication.
4. Review your plan details, quotas, and reset timing.
5. Use the refresh button in the view title bar whenever you want a fresh snapshot.

## Commands

- Copilot Insights: Refresh
- Copilot Insights: Open Settings
- Copilot Insights: Reset to Defaults

## Configuration

Search for "Copilot Insights" in VS Code Settings or use the settings button in the view title bar.

Key settings:

- `copilotInsights.showMood`: Show a mood indicator instead of the standard health status.
- `copilotInsights.progressBarMode`: Choose `remaining` or `used` for quota bars.
- `copilotInsights.statusBarLocation`: Choose `left`, `right`, or `both`.
- `copilotInsights.statusBarStyle`: Select the status bar visual style.
- `copilotInsights.statusBar.showName`: Toggle the `Copilot:` label.
- `copilotInsights.statusBar.showNumericalQuota`: Toggle `remaining/total` display.
- `copilotInsights.statusBar.showVisualIndicator`: Toggle the bar, ring, emoji, or similar style element.

Example:

```json
{
  "copilotInsights.progressBarMode": "remaining",
  "copilotInsights.statusBarLocation": "right",
  "copilotInsights.statusBarStyle": "detailed-original"
}
```

## How Pacing Works

Pacing guidance is based on the latest quota snapshot and the time remaining until the quota reset date.

The extension calculates:

- Daily average to stay within quota until reset.
- Weekly average.
- Approximate workday and work-hour averages.
- Daily capacity estimates for common premium model cost multipliers: `0.33x`, `1x`, and `3x`.

These values are intentionally conservative and designed for quick decision-making rather than formal forecasting.

## Data, Privacy, and Storage

Copilot Insights uses VS Code's built-in GitHub authentication provider and requests Copilot account data from:

- `https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/user`

The extension stores a small local history of recent premium quota snapshots in VS Code global state so it can show trend and prediction views. No external service is used by this extension to store your quota history.

## Troubleshooting

### No data is shown

- Make sure you are signed into the correct GitHub account in VS Code.
- Confirm your account has GitHub Copilot access.
- Trigger a manual refresh from the view title bar or command palette.

### GitHub API returns 403 or 404

- The account, org, or tenant may not expose this Copilot endpoint.
- The endpoint is internal and may change over time.

### Numbers look slightly different from older versions

- Recent versions preserve fractional precision for premium quota values and percentages instead of rounding everything to whole numbers.

## Development

Requirements:

- VS Code 1.107 or newer
